            <h1 className="head">Steps to be followed:</h1>

            <ul className="steps">
                <li>Heat oil in a pan. Once hot, add cumin seeds, chopped ginger and garlic.</li>
                <li>When the garlic and ginger turn golden, add all the spice powders, salt and mashed potatoes.</li>
                <li>Mix well and turn the heat off. Add the lime juice and chopped cilantro for garnish.</li>
                <li>Once the potato mixture cools down, divide the mixture into 10-12 equal portions and shape them into pin pong sized balls.</li>
                <li>Mix the chickpea flour, salt and chili powder. Add water in small quantities & mix well until you make a pancake (or dosa) like batter.</li>
                <li>Heat up the oil for frying.</li>
                <li>Coat each ball with the batter and drop into the hot oil. Do not overcrowd the oil (it brings down the temperature of oil all of a sudden).</li>
                <li>When they turn golden, drain them onto some paper towels. Set Aside.</li>
                <li>For the bread baskets, cut the bread into a discs using a cutter or just cut the crusts off.</li>
                <li>Flatten out the bread discs slightly using a rolling pin.</li>
                <li>Grease a muffin pan and set the rolled out bread discs in it.</li>
                <li>Bake at 350¬∞F for 5-7 min or until it gets toasted slightly. We do not want the bread to dry up. It has to be like toast; crispy outer layer but soft.</li>
                <li>Once done, Set aside and cool the baskets for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>When you are ready to serve, start assembling the vada pav bites.</li>
                <li>Place a little bit of tamarind sauce in the basket (depending on your taste), place the potato fritter on it.</li>
                <li>Now, pipe some green chutney on top and sprinkle some spicy garlic chutney.</li>
                <li> Your Vada Pao is Ready üòç </li>
